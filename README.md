This HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code creates a simple web page that represents a switch to turn a light bulb on and off. Here is the purpose of each part of the code:

CSS (contained in bulb.css file):
img and #off: Styles for the image and the button, respectively. Both elements are set to have an automatic margin on both the left and right, which centers them horizontally on the page.
body: Sets the background color of the page to white.
h1, p: Styles for headings and paragraphs, specifying a font and centering the text.

HTML:
The doctype is set and an HTML page is created with a head and a body.
Character encoding (UTF-8) and viewport settings are specified.
An external style sheet (bulb.css) is linked.
A title is provided to the page.
The body of the page is created with a header (h1), a paragraph (p), an image (img) and a button (button). The image has the ID myImage, and the button has the ID off. An external JavaScript script (bulb.js) is also loaded.

JavaScript (contained in bulb.js file):
The image element is obtained by its ID (myImage).
An array images is defined that contains two image file names.
A variable currentImage is initialized indicating the currently displayed image (0 for the first image).
A function changeImage() is defined that switches the image between the two available images when the button is clicked. If the current image is the first, it is changed to the second, and vice versa.
Clicking the button toggles between two images of the light bulb, thus simulating an on and off switch.
